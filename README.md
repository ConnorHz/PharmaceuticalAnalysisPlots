In this exercise, I was asked to analyze and plot the effects of different drugs on squamous cell carcinoma tumors in a population of mice. The two datasets provided contained information of each subject as well as the results of the trials over a 45 day time period. All the analysis was done using python, pandas, mattplotlib and jupyter notebooks. The last part of the exercise was to make three observations or inferences which I have included below as well as in the notebook.

1. From a scientific perspective, the drug trials were performed in the best possible way to to make meaningful observations. The genders of the population were even, each drug was tested on an equal number of mice, and the weights of the mice varied enough to get a good idea of the effect of each drug on different sized mice.

2. In the trials of Capomulin, there is a positive correlation between the weight of a mouse and the average tumor volume. Something I did notice was that it was never specified if the weight of the mouse included the tumor itself. Either way, it makes sense as one would assume, the larger the mouse, the larger the tumor.

3. Of the four most promising treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), Capomulin and Ramicane show the lowest tumor size after 45 days. This part of the study did not take into account the initial size of the tumors which would factor into the final size. A study that would be more meaningful would be to compare the differences in tumor size for each drug from the beginning of each trial to the end.
